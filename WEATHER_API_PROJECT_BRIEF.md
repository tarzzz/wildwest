# Weather Forecast API - Project Brief

## Project Goal
Build a production-ready REST API that provides weather forecast data to clients.

## Assigned Date
2026-01-29

## Team Structure
- **Engineering Manager**: nietzsche (orchestrating the project)
- **Solutions Architect**: Requested (pending spawn)
- **Software Engineers**: TBD (based on architect's design)
- **QA Engineer**: TBD (for testing phase)

## Current Status
**Phase**: Architecture & Design

### Progress
- [x] Project initiated
- [x] Solutions Architect requested
- [ ] Architecture design in progress
- [ ] Implementation plan pending

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture & Design (Current)
Solutions Architect will design:
- API endpoints and specifications
- Data models
- Technology stack
- Integration strategy with weather data providers
- System architecture

### Phase 2: Implementation (Upcoming)
Software Engineers will:
- Set up project infrastructure
- Implement API endpoints
- Integrate with weather data sources
- Implement caching and rate limiting
- Create documentation

### Phase 3: Testing (Upcoming)
QA Engineer will:
